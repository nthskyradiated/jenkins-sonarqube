the jenkins.yaml file will be created here and imported as an initial configuration-as-code to your Jenkins deployment. I have included a `jenkins.yaml.sample` file so users can see what the config (that I use) looks like. Take note I exported the sample file from my previous Jenkins deployments so that I could customize it and reuse it here, and so yours would look entirely different.
